-write about problems that we think that are important, but we didn't have time to consider, or which were to complicated to solve in such a short time\\
-example: which indicators are best to display in Radar-Chart-Diagram, when is a company considered as a Gender-Equal-Company. How should this be measured, how should different companies best be compared...

One problem we encounterd and couldn't solve, was the login process for the emplyoees. Our current implementation depends on, that each employee has to create his own account before takeing the survey.
The obvious disadvantage of this solution is, that each employee needs to remember his personal passwort. A better approach would be an automated login process, such that the blockchain account is set up in the
background. With this approach the passwort may be created randomly, without the users knowing about.\\
