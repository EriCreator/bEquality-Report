-write about problems that we think that are important, but we didn't have time to consider, or which were to complicated to solve in such a short time\\
-example: which indicators are best to display in Radar-Chart-Diagram, when is a company considered as a Gender-Equal-Company. How should this be measured, how should different companies best be compared...

One problem we encounterd and couldn't solve, was the login process for the employees. Our current implementation depends on, that each employee has to create his own account before taking the survey.
The obvious disadvantage of this solution is, that each employee needs to remember his personal password. A better approach would be an automated login process, such that the blockchain account is set up in the
background. With this approach the password may be created randomly, without the users knowing about.\\

An other problem we had was to determine which questions we should take for the survey in the application. The application on the mobile phone should actually be a small survey for the employee to fill in with around 5 minutes. But there are a lot of questions we have to ask in order to get useful data which can be compared with the data we got from the head of the companies. 

Also because of the lack of time we couldn't finish our implementation completely. The Mobile Applications needs to collect the data and put the collected data onto the block-chain.
