There are still some challenges to solve for this project.\\[5pt]
One major challenge is to provide a secure way of implementing a system equivalent to E-voting, i.e. to find a system where a user applies to a survey or evaluation and the data provided by him cannot be traced back to this user, even when the user can verify that the data provided by him is used and not some modified version of his data.\\
A way of solving this problem for this use-case (of a gender-equality index) it may be a solution to implement the system in such a way, that cheating for companies are too expensive to be profitable and the company therefore acts cooperatively and provides true data.
